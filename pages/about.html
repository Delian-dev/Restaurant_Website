                    <h3>We take pride in our almost 75 years history</h3>
                    <p>Opening its gates in 1950, DelBistro quickly became one of the most recognizable restaurants in Romania. Since the beggining, our mission was to bring on the table the best dishes from around the world. It was a very difficult mission, especially for that period, but our passion for food came on top regardless of the difficulties.
                         As years passed, a lot of famous people have tested our dishes and each one of them was pleasantly surprised. With that being said, we can't wait to have you come here, and be a part of our ongoing history.

                    <h3>We cannot omit the people that are making this possible</h3>
                    <p>We are renowned for our dishes, but very few people actually know the mastermind behind the kitchen's doors. Chef Leahu Teodor, proud owner of 2 Michelin Stars, and his team consisting of 9 people, make all the magic happen.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                        The partnership between DelBistro and Leahu has started in 2004 and has only been growing stronger since. It would be dishonorable to try to put into words what our Chef can achieve, because they wouldn't be enough. Therefore, we will let the food speak for ourselves.
